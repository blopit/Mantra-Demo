# Test Verification Rule

description: "Always verify test fixes by re-running tests"
globs: ["test_*.py"]
alwaysApply: false

## Purpose
- Ensure test fixes are properly verified
- Prevent incomplete or incorrect test fixes
- Maintain test suite reliability

## Requirements
1. After any test file changes:
   - Re-run the specific test file
   - Re-run related test files
   - Verify no regressions

2. For test framework changes:
   - Run the full test suite
   - Check for side effects

3. Document test results:
   - Show pass/fail status
   - Report any new failures
   - Note any skipped tests

## Implementation
1. Run modified test file:
   

2. Run related tests:
   

3. For framework changes:
   

## Verification Steps
1. Run tests immediately after changes
2. Check test output carefully
3. Address any new failures
4. Document test results
5. Only proceed if all tests pass
