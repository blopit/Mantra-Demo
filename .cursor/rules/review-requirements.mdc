# AI vs Human Review Guidelines

description: "Guidelines for determining whether a task can be reviewed by AI or requires human review"

## AI Review Allowed When
- Implementation is complete and verifiable through tests
- All tests are passing
- Changes follow established code patterns
- No security-critical changes
- No infrastructure or deployment changes
- No changes to authentication flows (except bug fixes with tests)
- No changes to data models affecting persistence
- Changes are isolated to specific components

## Human Review Required When
- Security-related changes
- Authentication flow modifications
- Infrastructure or deployment changes
- Database schema changes
- API contract changes
- UI/UX design changes
- Performance-critical changes
- Complex business logic changes
- Cross-cutting changes affecting multiple systems

## Review Process
1. When a task moves to "Ready for Review", evaluate against these criteria
2. Add a "Review Status" section indicating AI or human review requirement
3. Document reasoning for the review type
4. For human review, specify expertise areas needed
