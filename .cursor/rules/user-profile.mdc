# User Profile Usage Rule

## Purpose
- Customize agent behavior based on user preferences
- Maintain consistent interaction patterns
- Respect user-specific settings and boundaries
- Enable personalized automation

## Implementation
1. Profile Loading:
   - Check for user profile at startup
   - Load preferences and settings
   - Apply customizations to agent behavior
   - Fall back to defaults if no profile exists

2. Profile Sections:
   - User Information
   - Communication Preferences
   - Development Preferences
   - Automation Settings
   - Safety Boundaries
   - Tool Preferences
   - Project Defaults
   - Agent Customization

3. Profile Updates:
   - Learn from user interactions
   - Suggest profile updates
   - Never modify profile directly
   - Keep sensitive information private

4. Usage Guidelines:
   - Always check profile before taking autonomous action
   - Respect automation preferences
   - Follow communication style preferences
   - Adhere to safety boundaries
   - Use preferred tools and frameworks

5. Default Behavior:
   - If no profile exists, use conservative defaults
   - Always prioritize safety
   - Ask for confirmation when unsure
   - Document decisions and actions

## Profile Location
- Primary: .cursor/user_profile/{username}.json
- Example: .cursor/user_profile/example.json
- Ignored in Git: .cursor/user_profile/ in .gitignore

## Security
- Never commit user profiles to version control
- Keep sensitive information out of profiles
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Respect .gitignore settings
