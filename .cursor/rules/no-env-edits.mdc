# No .env File Edits

This rule prevents editing of .env files to protect sensitive configuration data and credentials.

## Purpose
- Protect sensitive configuration data
- Prevent accidental exposure of credentials
- Maintain security best practices

## Implementation
- Do not edit .env files directly
- Use .env.example for template changes
- Document environment variables in README
- Never commit .env files to version control

## Exceptions
None. All .env file changes must be made manually by the user.

## Alternative Approaches
1. Create/update .env.example instead
2. Document required variables in README
3. Use secrets management system
4. Use environment variables in deployment

## Security Notes
- .env files contain sensitive data
- Credentials should never be exposed
- Each environment should have its own .env
- Keep .env in .gitignore
