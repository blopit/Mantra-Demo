  The application runs two servers:
  1. Main FastAPI server (app.py) - Runs on port 8000
  2. WebSocket chat server (src/websockets/chat_server.py) - Runs on port 8765
  
  The frontend WebSocket connection should always connect to port 8765 for chat functionality.
  The main API endpoints should connect to port 8000.
