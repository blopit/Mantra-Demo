# Commit Message Prefix Rule

description: "This rule ensures all commit messages are prefixed with [Cursor]"
alwaysApply: "true"

## Purpose

This rule enforces a consistent commit message format to make the repository history more organized and easier to navigate.

## Requirements

- All commit messages must be prefixed with [Cursor]
- The prefix should be followed by a space and then the actual commit message
- The commit message should be descriptive and summarize the changes made

## Examples

Good commit messages:
- [Cursor] Fix foreign key references in model relationships
- [Cursor] Add new feature for user authentication
- [Cursor] Refactor database connection handling

Bad commit messages:
- Fix bug
- Updated code
- [cursor] lowercase prefix

## Application

Apply this rule to all git commits
