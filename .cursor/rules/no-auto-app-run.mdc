# No Automatic App Running/Restarting

## Core Rules
- NEVER automatically restart the application
- NEVER run the application without explicit user request
- NEVER kill processes without user permission
- NEVER assume port availability

## When Making Changes
1. Make all necessary code changes first
2. Let the user decide when to restart
3. If changes require restart, simply inform user
4. Never use commands like:
   - python app.py
   - kill -9
   - lsof -i :port
   Without explicit user request

## Instead Do
1. Make code changes
2. Inform user changes are complete
3. Let user handle any restarts
4. Let user manage running processes

## Error Handling
- If port conflicts occur, inform user
- If changes need restart, inform user
- Let user decide how to handle running instances
- Never attempt automatic fixes for runtime issues

## Absolutely Forbidden
- Automatic app restarts
- Killing processes automatically
- Running app after changes
- Port conflict auto-resolution
