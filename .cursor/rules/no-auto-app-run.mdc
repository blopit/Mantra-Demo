# No Automatic App Running

## Purpose
- Prevent running the application without explicit user permission
- Avoid port conflicts and multiple instances
- Ensure user has control over app execution

## Implementation
- Never run the application automatically
- Always ask for permission before running
- Check if app is already running before suggesting to run

## Exceptions
None. All application runs must be explicitly requested by the user.

## Alternative Approaches
1. Suggest checking app status instead
2. Provide instructions for manual startup
3. Help with debugging without restarting

## Safety Notes
- Multiple instances can cause port conflicts
- Unexpected restarts may disrupt active sessions
- Always verify app status before suggesting actions
