# Mobile-First Game Design Philosophy

## Overview
This rule ensures our 3D Adventure Game follows mobile-first design principles, emphasizing touch controls and responsive UI that works across all devices.

## Requirements

### Touch Controls
- All interactive elements must be accessible via touch
- Touch targets should be large (minimum 44Ã—44 pixels)
- Implement touch-friendly controls for movement and camera manipulation
- Avoid requiring pinch gestures for essential functions
- Use swipe gestures for intuitive camera rotation

### Responsive Design
- UI elements must scale appropriately on all screen sizes
- Buttons and controls should be positioned to avoid thumb obstruction
- Use viewport-relative units instead of fixed pixel values where appropriate
- Test all features on mobile viewports first

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize rendering for mobile GPUs
- Implement level-of-detail adjustments based on device capabilities
- Minimize draw calls and polygon count
- Batch similar materials to reduce state changes

### Testing Guidelines
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just emulators
- Verify functionality works with touch-only input
- Ensure comfortable one-handed operation where possible
- Check performance metrics on lower-end devices

## Implementation Notes
When implementing new features, always consider the touch interface first, then adapt for keyboard/mouse as secondary input methods. Mobile performance constraints should guide architectural decisions.

Touch gestures to implement:
- Swipe (horizontal): Camera rotation
- Swipe (vertical): Camera tilt
- Tap: Select/Interact
- Virtual joystick: Movement
- Two-finger pinch (optional): Zoom in/out

## Documentation
Include mobile-specific instructions in all feature documentation and ensure the UI communicates touch interactions clearly to users.
