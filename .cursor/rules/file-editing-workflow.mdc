# File Editing Workflow

## General File Editing Principles
- Create one type of content per file to maintain organization
- Use consistent formatting within each file type
- When files fail to save properly, try alternative creation methods

## MDC File Creation Process
DO NOT USE edit_tool tool with .mdc files specifcially use `cat`

## Chunked Echo Approach for Large Files
1. Create base file with first chunk:
   ```
   echo -e '# Title\n\ndescription: "Description text"\n\n## First Section\n- Bullet point' > filename.mdc
   ```
2. Add subsequent chunks:
   ```
   echo -e '\n\n## Second Section\n- More content' >> filename.mdc
   ```
3. Set permissions after all chunks:
   ```
   chmod 644 filename.mdc
   ```
4. Always verify content is complete: `cat filename.mdc`

## JSON File Editing
1. Validate existing JSON structure before editing
2. Maintain proper indentation (2 spaces) and formatting
3. Use the edit_file tool for most JSON edits
4. For complex JSON files, validate after editing
5. Set proper permissions after editing

## Handling Special File Types
- For binary files: Use appropriate tools to modify
- For configuration files: Always create backups before editing
- For template files: Preserve placeholders during edits
- For source code: Follow language-specific formatting conventions
- For documentation: Follow established documentation structure

## Troubleshooting File Creation Issues
- If files appear corrupted, check terminal output for errors
- For permission denied errors, verify directory permissions
- If content is truncated, try the chunked approach
- For MDC files specifically, check for YAML frontmatter validity
- When all else fails, try creating file with basic echo then append content
