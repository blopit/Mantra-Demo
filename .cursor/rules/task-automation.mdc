# Task Automation Rules

## Purpose
- Ensure maximum task automation
- Minimize unnecessary human intervention
- Clearly identify tasks requiring human action

## Implementation
- AI must attempt to automate all possible task aspects
- Use available tools for planning, coding, testing, and fixing
- Move tasks requiring human intervention to tasks/Human/

## Task Execution Flow
1. Planning Phase
   - Break down task into steps
   - Identify automatable components
   - Flag human-required actions

2. Automation Phase
   - Use tools to implement solutions
   - Run automated tests
   - Document progress

3. Human Intervention
   - Create task in tasks/Human/ if needed
   - Clearly specify required human actions
   - Continue automation after human input

## Task Location Rules
- Fully automated tasks: Regular priority folders
- Human-required tasks: tasks/Human/ directory
- Mixed tasks: Both locations with cross-references

## Required Tools Usage
- Planning: Sequential thinking tool
- Code: Edit and search tools
- Testing: Test running tools
- Fixing: Debugging tools
- Documentation: File creation tools

## No Exceptions
- Never skip automation attempts
- Always document automation decisions
- Keep human intervention minimal
